# Project to test efficiency of angular elements

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
These scripts are used in the project/index.html file. Which is a seperate html project (does not need angular to run).
In de index.html, adjust the path to the correct scripts that were build before.

Now the index.html can be opened for a little POC. Each button at the top calls a function of the web components below.
